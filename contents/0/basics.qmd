## Data structure
A dataset is a collection of *values*. Values are organized in two ways. Every value belongs to a *variable* and an *observation*. 


::: {#def-}
# Variables and Observations @Wic2014
- A **variable** contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units.
- An **observation** contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes.
:::
 


::: {#def-}
# Quantitative and Qualitative @Men2020
- **Quantitative data** are observations measured on a naturally occurring numerical scale. It is also called *numerical data*.
- **Qualitative data** are nonnumerical data that can only be classified into one of a group of categories. It is also called *categorical data*.
:::



::: {#def-}
# Discrete and Continuous
- Discrete random variable: A random variable that assumes either a finite number of values or an infinite sequence of values such as 0, 1, 2...
- Continuous random variable: A random variable that may assume any numerical value in an interval or collection of intervals.
:::




::: {.callout-note}
# Random variables
A variable in a dataset can be modeled by a *random variable*. The probability density function / probability mass function of the random variable can describe the distribution of all possible values of the variable in a dataset. 

Then to make a mearuement is the same as to take a sample from the random variable.  


<!-- On the other side, to study a variable in a dataset, we need to identify the random variable corresponding to it. In the rest of the notes we will use variables in a dataset and random variables interchangably. -->

## Data Visualization
### Qualitative (categorical) data
Usually the most important is the **class relative frequency**: 
$$
\text{class relative frequency}=\frac{\text{class frequency}}{n}.
$$

To display it, we could use table, bar chart or pie chart.


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}




# Example: Possums

All the example about possums below come from the dataset [here](./assests/data/possum.csv).



::: {.panel-tabset}


# R
```{r}
df <- read.csv('possum.csv')
head(df)
```


We first compute the frequency table of the variable `pop`:

```{r}
table(df$pop)
```
or relative frequency talbe:
```{r}
table(df$pop)/length(df$pop)
```

Then we could draw the barplot of this variable:

```{r}
barplot(table(df$pop))
```

and the pie plot:
```{r}
pie(table(df$pop))
```

Note that `table` is handling the statistics, while `barplot` and `pie` draw on top of the result from `table`.



# Python

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("possum.csv")
df.head()
```



We first compute the frequency table of the variable `pop`:

```{python}
df['pop'].value_counts()
```
or relative frequency talbe:
```{python}
df['pop'].value_counts(normalize=True)
```

Then we could draw the barplot of this variable:

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
vc = df['pop'].value_counts()
plt.bar(vc.index, vc)
```

and the pie plot:
```{python}
_ = plt.pie(vc)
```

Note that `table` is handling the statistics, while `barplot` and `pie` draw on top of the result from `table`.

### Quantitative (numerical) data

We would like to use **histogram** to display these type of data. In other words, we split the range into small segments (called *bins*), and count the frequency or relative frequency of data falling into these bins.


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Example: Possums
```{r}
df <- read.csv('possum.csv')
head(df)
```

We display the histogram of `headL`. We could use `breaks` to control the number of bins.
```{r}
hist(df$headL, breaks=10)
```

The function `hist` does not just draw the histogram. It also provide many infomation we might need. 

```{r}
res <- hist(df$headL, breaks=10)
res
```

:::

### Some statistics

For a quantitative data, we would also like to compute some statistics: minx, max, quartiles, median and mean. In R, we could use `summary` to compute them, and use box plots to show them.


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Example: Possums


```{r}
summary(df)
```

We could use the box plot to show these infomation. It consists of a box, two lines and possibly some points:

- The box in the box plot extends from the lower quartile to the upper quartile. The difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile is called the inter-quartile range (IQR).
- The lines, known as *whiskers*, extends to one and a half times the interquartile range, but then they are limited to reaching actual data points. 
- The points, considered as *outliers*, are those which are not covered by the box and the lines.


```{r}
boxplot(df$headL)
```


:::

### Relations among multiple variables

We could show the relation between two variables in a scatter plot.


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Example: Possums

The cases that both variables are numerical continuous:
```{r}
plot(df$headL, df$skullW)
```

The cases that one variable is categorical:

```{r}
plot(as.factor(df$pop), df$skullW)
```

Note that in this case, the categorical data has to be a factor. And once it is cast into a factor, the plot is multiple box plots for each category.


We can see pairwise plots for each pair of variables. Note that before the plot, we have to cast `pop` and `sex` into factors.

```{r}
df$pop <- as.factor(df$pop)
df$sex <- as.factor(df$sex)
pairs(df)
```
Pair plot is very important since it can easily help us to find the expected relations between variables. We will use it a lot in regression analysis.

# Statistical inference @Men2020
- A **statistical inference** is an estimate, prediction, or some other generatlization about a population based on information contianed in a sample. 
- A **measure of reliability** is a statement about the degree of uncertainty associated with a statistical inference.
