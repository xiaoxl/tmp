The process of finding the model that relates $y$ to $x$ and best fits the data is called *regression analysis*.



- The variable $y$ to be modeled is called the **dependent variable** (or **response variable**). Its expected value is denoted $\Exp(y)$.


**General Form of probabilistic Model in Regression** is 
$$
y=E(y)+\varepsilon
$$


## Estimation


a statistic whose sampling distribution has the mean around the proposed value and a small variance. If the means are equal: unbiased estimator. No: biased.

## build a model that fits the data


predicted value: $\hat{y}$, $\hat{\beta}$, ...

- model: $y=\Exp(y)+\varepsilon$



@Jam2023

- want to estimate $f$: $Y=f(X)+\varepsilon$
- want to use $\hat{f}$ to estimate $f$: $\hat{Y}=\hat{f}(X)$.
