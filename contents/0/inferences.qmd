### Sampling


Consider a random variable $X$ with an unknown distribution. Our information about the distribution of $X$ comes from a sample on $X$: $\qty{X_1,\ldots,X_n}$.

- The sample ovservations $\qty{X_1,\ldots,X_n}$ have the same distribution as $X$.
- $n$ denotes the **sample size**.
- When the sample is actually drawn, we use $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ as the **realizations** of the sample.


::: {#def-}
# Random sample
If the random variables $X_1,\ldots, X_n$ are iid, then these random variable constitute a **random sample** of size $n$ from the common distribution.

# Statistics
Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ denote a sample on a random variable $X$. Let $T=T(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ be a function of the sample. $T$ is called a **statistic**. Once a sample is drawn, $t=T(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is called the *realization* of $T$. 
:::


::: {#def-}
# Sampling distribution
- The distribution of $T$ is called the **sampling distribution**.
- The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is called the **standard error of estimate**.

::: {#thm-}
# The Central Limit Theorem
For large sample sizes, the mean $\bar{y}$ of a sample from a population with mean $\mu$ and a standard deviation $\sigma$ has a sampling distribution that is approximately normal.

### Point estimation

Assume that the distribution of $X$ is known down to an unknown parameter $\theta$ where $\theta$ can be a vector. Then the pdf of $X$ can be written as $f(x;\theta)$. In this case we might find some statistic $T$ to estimate $\theta$. This is called a **point estimator** of $\theta$. A realization $t$ is called an **estimate** of $\theta$.


::: {#def-}
# Unbiasedness
Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ is a sample on a random varaible $X$ with pdf $f(x;\theta)$. Let $T$ be a statistic. We say that $T$ is an **unbiased** estimator of $\theta$ if $E(T)=\theta$.

Let $X$ be a random variable, with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Consider a sample $\set{X_i}$ of size $n$. By definition all $X_i$'s are iid. Therefore $\Exp\qty(X_i)=\mu$, and $\Var\qty(X_i)=\sigma^2$ for any $i=1,\ldots, N$.

Consider the following statistics:

- $\bar{\mu}=\dfrac1N\sum_{i=1}^NX_i$,
- $\bar{\sigma}^2=\dfrac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N(X_i-\bar{\mu})^2$.

1. $\Exp(\bar{\mu})=\mu$.
2. $\Exp(\bar{\sigma}^2)=\sigma^2$.

# Proof
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Exp\qty(\bar{\mu})&=\Exp\qty(\frac1N\sum_{i=1}^NX_i)=\frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N\Exp\qty(X_i)=\frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N\mu=\mu,\\
\Exp\qty(\bar{\sigma}^2)&=\frac{1}{N-1}\Exp\qty[\sum_{i=1}^N(X_i-\bar{\mu})^2]=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N\Exp\mqty[\qty(X_i-\bar{\mu})^2]\\
&=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N\qty(\Var\qty(X_i-\bar{\mu})+\qty(\Exp\qty(X_i-\bar{\mu}))^2)\\
&=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N\qty(\Var\qty(\frac{N-1}{N}X_i-\frac1NX_1-\ldots-\frac1NX_N)+\qty(\Exp\qty(X_i)-\Exp\qty(\bar{\mu}))^2)\\
&=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N\qty(\frac{(N-1)^2}{N^2}\Var\qty(X_i)+\frac1{N^2}\Var\qty(X_1)+\ldots+\frac1{N^2}\Var\qty(X_N))\\
&=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N\qty(\frac{(N-1)^2}{N^2}\sigma^2+\frac1{N^2}\sigma^2+\ldots+\frac1{N^2}\sigma^2)\\
&=\frac{N}{N-1}\frac{(N-1)^2+N-1}{N^2}\sigma^2=\sigma^2.

::: {#def-}
The following are the unbiased estimators of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ of $X$.

1. $\bar{\mu}=\dfrac1N\sum_{i=1}^NX_i$ is called the *sample mean* of the samples. 
2. $\bar{\sigma}^2=\dfrac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N(X_i-\bar{\mu})^2$ is called the *sample variance* of the samples.


:::


::: {.callout-caution}
Please pay attention to the denominator of the sample variance. The $N-1$ is due to the degree of freedom: all $X_i$'s and $\bar{\mu}$ are not independent to each other.

### Confidence intervals

::: {#def-}
# Confidence interval
Consider a sample of $X$. Fix a number $0<\alpha<1$. Let $L$ and $U$ be two statistics. We say the interval $(L,U)$ is a $(1-\alpha)100\%$ **confidence interval** for $\theta$ if 

$$
1-\alpha=\Pr[\theta\in(L,U)].
$$
:::


::: {#thm-}
# Large-Sample $100(1-\alpha)\%$ Confidence interval
$$
L,U=\bar{\mu}\pm z_{\alpha/2}\qty(\frac{\bar{\sigma}}{\sqrt{n}}),
$$
where $z_{\alpha/2}=1.96$ if $\alpha=5\%$.

:::

- For any $n$, if $X_i\sim \mathcal N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, $T_n=\dfrac{\bar{X}-\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}}$ has a Student's $t$-distribution of degree of freedom $n-1$. 
- When $n$ is big enough, for any distribution $X_i$, $Z_n=\dfrac{\bar{X}-\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}}$ is approximately $\mathcal N(0,1)$. 
- Student's $t$-distribution of degree of freedom $n-1$ is approaching $\mathcal N(0,1)$ when $n$ is increasing. When $n=30$ they are very close to each other. Therefore in many cases Statisticians require sample size $\geq30$.
- For large sample or small sample, the coefficients to compute confidence intervals are $z_{\alpha/2}$ or $t_{\alpha/2}$. These two numbers come from normal distribution or Student's $t$-distribution.
